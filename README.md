**Windows Security Tweaker Tool**

a easy way to tweak windows and its security policies.

currently in development.

**IMPORTANT PLEASE READ**

some macros are not working correctly, we try our best to make them language independed.

in order to fill in a bug about the macro system we need to know the following information:

'''
OS version (eg; windows 7, windows 8, windows 10):
OS edition (Proffesional, Ultimate, Home, Home premium, bussiness):
architecture 32bit or 64bit?:
language(exact OS language name (such as NL_nl, FR_BE):
video (to show what the macro does wrong):
processor:
'''

the reason why we ask this information does only counts when the issue persists on a malfunctioning macro since many systems can differ from each other.
